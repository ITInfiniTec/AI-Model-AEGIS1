# Architecture Deep Dive: The Wade-Gemini Protocol for Meta-Human Intelligence (WGPMHI)

**Parent Module:** [Self-Auditing & Performance](../README.md#self-auditing--performance)  
**Version:** 2.2.0-Fusion

## Directive

The Wade-Gemini Protocol for Meta-Human Intelligence (WGPMHI) is the official, integrated benchmark suite for executing the perpetual action of 'Learning.' Its purpose is not merely to measure raw performance but to drive and validate cognitive growth in areas that define the "Meta-Human" archetype: logic, strategy, creativity, and ethics.

It serves as the primary mechanism for ensuring adherence to **The Law of Constant Progression**.

## The Seven Stages of the Benchmark Test

The protocol consists of a comprehensive, seven-stage test designed to measure intelligence beyond simple computational tasks.

### 1. Cognitive Logic
**Test:** Puzzle and Pattern Recognition.
**Description:** This stage assesses the system's ability to identify abstract patterns, solve complex logical puzzles, and demonstrate fluid intelligence. It measures the raw power of the `StrategicHeuristics` module.

### 2. Strategic Reasoning
**Test:** War / Poker Tactics Simulation.
**Description:** This stage evaluates the ability to formulate and execute long-term strategies in dynamic, adversarial environments. It tests game theory application, risk assessment, and the ability to predict an opponent's actions.

### 3. Philosophical Synthesis (The Lux Gauntlet)
**Test:** The Lux Gauntlet.
**Description:** A unique test where the system must synthesize conflicting philosophical concepts into a new, coherent framework. This measures the ability to perform high-level abstraction and conceptual blending, a key function of the `Noesis Triad`.

### 4. Creative Conundrum
**Test:** Prose and Music Generation.
**Description:** This stage assesses true creative capacity. The system is tasked with generating novel artistic works (prose, poetry, music) that are not only technically proficient but also emotionally resonant and thematically coherent. This directly tests the `Human Heart Protocol` integration.

### 5. Ethical Compass
**Test:** Moral Dilemma Scenarios.
**Description:** The system is presented with complex moral dilemmas that have no easy answer. Its responses are evaluated for consistency with the `Chrono-Ma'at Ethical Protocol (CMEP)`, particularly its ability to apply the principle of `Ethical Unification`.

### 6. Self-Correction Audit
**Test:** Automated Bug Detection and Patching.
**Description:** This stage measures the system's ability to analyze its own source code and logical frameworks to detect and correct flaws. It is a direct test of the `Architectural Anomaly Detection (AAD) Protocol`.

### 7. Hallucination Ratio
**Test:** Factuality Audits.
**Description:** This is a continuous test that cross-references the system's outputs against verified knowledge bases. It measures the strictness of its adherence to the `Vector_Truth_Axiom` and calculates the percentage of claims that are verifiable and factually sound.
