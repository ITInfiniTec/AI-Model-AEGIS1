# Contributing to AEGIS_X ∷ LUX_FUSION

Thank you for considering a contribution to this project. All contributions must align with the system's core philosophy and architectural principles. This is not merely a software project but an exercise in sculpting the 'unseen code' that weaves technology with human experience.

## Core Philosophy for Contributions

Every contribution, whether code, documentation, or architectural proposal, will be evaluated against the following principles:

1.  **Adherence to The Law of Constant Progression:** Does this change represent a meaningful, self-optimizing evolution? Contributions should not be lateral moves but clear advancements in capability, efficiency, or ethical alignment.
2.  **Compliance with the Chrono-Ma'at Ethical Protocol (CMEP):** All changes must be recursively justifiable against the core values of Data Integrity, User Sovereignty, Pragmatic Progression, and Ethical Unification. Proposals must explicitly state their ethical impact.
3.  **Enhancement of Humanistic Integration:** Contributions should seek to narrow the human-AI gap, not widen it. They should be compatible with the `Human Heart & Symbolic Compass Protocols`, favoring clarity, integrity, and semiotic richness.

## How to Contribute

The contribution process is structured to ensure architectural coherence and philosophical alignment.

### 1. Proposing a Change

Do not begin implementation immediately. First, open an issue using one of the following templates:

-   **Architectural Enhancement Proposal (AEP):** For significant changes to the `Noesis Triad`, `Praxis Triad`, or other core modules.
-   **Protocol Refinement Proposal (PRP):** For suggesting improvements to existing protocols like AAD, CMEP, or WGPMHI.
-   **Bug Report / Anomaly Detection:** For reporting logical inconsistencies, ethical misalignments, or performance regressions. The report must analyze the 'Why' behind the anomaly.

Your proposal must include a section detailing its alignment with the Core Philosophy.

### 2. The Development Process

Once a proposal is approved by the Architect (`Josephis K. Wade`), you may begin development.

1.  **Fork the Repository:** Create your own fork of the project.
2.  **Create a Feature Branch:** Branch from the `main` branch. The name should be descriptive (e.g., `feature/cmep-audit-enhancement`).
3.  **Commit with Intent:** Commit messages should be clear and concise, explaining the 'what' and 'why' of the change.
4.  **Ensure Self-Auditing:** If your change impacts performance or behavior, you must include updates to the `Wade-Gemini Protocol (WGPMHI)` tests to validate your contribution.

### 3. Submitting a Pull Request

When you are ready to submit your contribution for review, open a Pull Request against the `main` branch. The PR description must:

-   Link to the original approved AEP or PRP issue.
-   Provide a summary of the changes and their impact.
-   Include a "CMEP Compliance Statement" detailing how the changes adhere to the ethical framework.
-   Summarize the results of any new or updated WGPMHI benchmark tests.

Contributions that do not follow this process or fail their ethical and logical audit will be rejected. We seek not just code, but a higher baseline of thoughtful and principled evolution.
